# Restaurant Analysis and Feature Engineering
This project aims to analyze a dataset containing information about restaurants, focusing on features such as table booking, online delivery, price range, and ratings. The dataset provides information about various restaurants, including their names, addresses, price ranges, whether they offer table booking and online delivery, and their ratings.

# Tasks:

## Table Booking and Online Delivery Analysis:
- Determine the percentage of restaurants that offer table booking and online delivery.
- Compare the average ratings of restaurants with table booking and those without.
- Analyze the availability of online delivery among restaurants with different price ranges.

## Price Range Analysis:
- Determine the most common price range among all the restaurants.
- Calculate the average rating for each price range.
- Identify the color that represents the highest average rating among different price ranges.

## Feature Engineering:
- Extract additional features from existing columns, such as the length of the restaurant name or address.
- Create new features like "Has Table Booking" or "Has Online Delivery" by encoding categorical variables.
